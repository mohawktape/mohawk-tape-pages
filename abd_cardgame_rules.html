                    Welcome to your game pack! Inside, you’ll find several envelopes, each labeled with a specific activity on the front.<br><br>
                    Every envelope contains three visible Option Cards. Read through all three and choose one Option Card to customize your activity to your liking.<br><br>
                    You’ll also find a few Mystery Cards inside each envelope. Each Mystery Card adds a unique twist to your chosen activity. Select only one Mystery Card — it will guide your experience toward either a spicy or connective mood.<br><br>
                    Each Mystery Card is marked with chili peppers 🌶️ (for spice) and chain links 🔗 (for connection). The more chili peppers, the hotter your activity will be! Remember: only read your Mystery Card after you’ve selected it.<br><br>
                    <strong>Caution:</strong> Three-chili cards are intensely spicy and meant only for those feeling bold and adventurous.<br><br>
                    You’ll also receive three Super Cards:<br><br>
                    <strong>Skip</strong> – Skip this Mystery Card entirely.<br><br>
                    <strong>Reroll</strong> – Draw a new Mystery Card to replace the one you picked.<br><br>
                    <strong>Swap</strong> – Draw a second Mystery Card, then choose between the two.</p>
